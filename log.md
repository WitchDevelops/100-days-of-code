# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: 2023-03-04

**Today's Progress**: 

* Decided to start. 
* Read a chapter on Flexbox from [Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS](https://www.packtpub.com/product/responsive-web-design-with-html5-and-css-fourth-edition/9781803242712)
* Worked on the form on Sofia's website

**Thoughts:** 

There is a nice shorthand to center an element within a div using flex.
``` place-items: center; ``` - I need to remember this and use it.
Sending a webform is impossible with HTML. All it can do is open the mailing software and this is not what I want. I need to figure out how to do it using PHP.

## Day 2: 2023-03-05

**Today's Progress**:

* started learning ancient technology (PHP).

**Thoughts:**

Why are comments so similar yet different for various languages?
``` <?php
// I'm a single line comment in php - but also in JavaScript!
# I'm a single line comment in php.
/* and I'm a multiline comment in php, but also in JavaSctipt and CSS */
```
ugh

## Day 3: 2023-03-06

**Today's Progress**:

* continued learning PHP

**Thoughts:**

PHP is easy. I need some mental adjusting, because whenever I need to declara a variable my instict tells me: use ```let```.

## Day 4: 2023-03-07

**Today's Progress**:

* learned about destructuring syntax in ES6

**Thoughts:**

Destructuring syntax is ok. Destruturing nested objects and renaming the variables is unintuitive. Take this code snippet for example:
```const {today: {low: lowToday, high: highToday}} = LOCAL_FORECAST; ```
```LOCAL_FORECAST``` is a parent object, ```today``` is a nested object that contains ```low``` and ```high``` keys for its properties. That colon to rename them is confusing.
