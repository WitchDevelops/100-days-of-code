# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 04, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 
* Decided to start. 
* Read a chapter on Flexbox from [Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS](https://www.packtpub.com/product/responsive-web-design-with-html5-and-css-fourth-edition/9781803242712)

**Thoughts:** 
There is a nice shorthand to center an element within a div using flex.
``` place-items: center; ``` - I need to remember this and use it.
